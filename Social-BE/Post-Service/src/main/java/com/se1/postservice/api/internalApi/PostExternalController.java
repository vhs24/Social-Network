That's why you as a parent, guardian, relative, or babysitter play a crucial part in their development. Not only are you helping their fine, gross, and motor skills develop, you're shaping their perspective of life and their surroundings each and every time you are with them. Taking care of a young child might seem challenging at first, especially with all of the tantrums and crying, but by the end of the day you'll be a pro. Read on to discover how you can take care of young children!<h1>1</h1><div><b>Wake the children up at a set time every day.</b> This can easily be adjusted when necessary, but start with a time such as seven thirty or eight in the morning. You can have an alarm go off for the children to wake up to, such as a favorite children's song or a soft bell. Avoid something too loud, such as a rooster crowing or rock music. If they don't wake up right away, you can gently tap them and say something such as, 'Hey, it's time to get up, sleepyhead'. Once they are awake, you can start getting them ready for the day by getting them dressed, doing their hair, and brushing their teeth.<ul><li>Let the kids feel responsible and a part of their routine by giving them options. You can lay out two shirts and let them choose a shirt, let them choose to wash their face or brush their teeth first, or allow them to either help you set the table or get you the food you need from the refrigerator.</li></ul><a href=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Take-Care-of-Young-Children\">link tham khao</a> ";
